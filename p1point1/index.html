He began his journey into comedy at age 17 when his brother encouraged him to try stand up at a local comedy club. Once the comedy bug bit, Sandler studied acting at NYU, took improv classes, and landed as a writer (later actor) on SNL in 1990. That "big break" led him on a track to be one of the biggest comedy stars in history.  </p>
