	<h2>Topic 1 - Burn Baby Burn: The History of Disco</h2>
	<p>Disco emerged in the 1970s from Black, Latino & LGBTQ communities in New York City and quickly became an expression of joy, celebration, and inclusion. With artists like Donna Summer, the BeeGees, and CHIC, disco's infectious beats and funky style permeated the mainstream, dominating dancefloors all around the world.</p>
	<h2>Topic 2 -The Sandman: The Story of Adam Sandler </h2>
	<p> Adam Sandler was born in 1966 in Brooklyn, NY and grew up in Manchester, New Hampshire. He began his journey into comedy at age 17 when his brother encouraged him to try stand up at a local comedy club. Once the comedy bug bit, Sandler studied acting at NYU, took improv classes, and landed as a writer (later actor) on SNL in 1990. That "big break" led him on a track to be one of the biggest comedy stars in history.  </p>
	<h2> Topic 3 - Everybody Sings: The Origins of Karaoke </h2>
	<p> With its rumored origins in Japan, karaoke ('kara' meaning empty and a shortened version of 'orchestra') began as a form of performance where professional singers would use instrumental backing tracks when a live band or orchestra was unavailable. It then its way to the general public in the 70s as a mix of Japanese inventors who created versions of karaoke machines and it's largely debated over who is the actual "father" of karaoke. However, the activity as we officially know it today, popped up in 2003 as karaoke discs and slowly spread into bars and clubs once its popularity and demand grew. </p>
